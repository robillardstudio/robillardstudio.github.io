**Gaëtan Robillard** is an artist, a researcher and a visiting professor. He produces films and sound installations about the climate and the algorithmization of the world in the post truth era. His work is regularly shown in international art centers such as Palais de Tokyo (Paris), Hessel Museum (New York), and Pearl Art Museum (Shanghai). He has published various articles about the materialization of the algorithmic image, and he also has been supported by major institutes such as the ZKM in Germany, and the European consortium MediaFutures (Horizon 2020). His thesis "Algorithms at work: Early Computer Art and Generative Environments" (2022) is a research-creation in art sciences and digital images. It focuses on the one hand on early Computer Art in Germany, its traces and its updating; and on the other hand on the production of a series of generative environments, as with Critical Climate Machine. In addition, Robillard gives lectures and workshops, particularly on the arrival of deep learning technologies in art.

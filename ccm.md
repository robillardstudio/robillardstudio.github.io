**Project**

Critical Climate Machine is a research based project that quantifies and reveals the mechanisms of misinformation on global warming. The project environment consists of a walk-in room with a data sculpture and a sound installation, resulting from participatory work. The research draws on cognitive sciences, which have shown – much like inoculation in biology, that disinformation can be neutralized by exposing the public to a weak form of disinformation.

Using natural language processing, the sculpture analyzes myths about climate change. Its software continuously processes false arguments collected from Twitter. As a result the sculpture becomes a landscape of "error codes", which the audience is invited to map using a list of misleading claims. On a vertical screen, a visualization renders the thermal effects of the process on the hardware.

Constructed dialogues surround the sculpture. False arguments are voiced by a speech entity. A second one refutes these claims in response. The composition is based on six voices which were recorded during workshops with students about climate change. Participants were introduced to The Refutation Game – a card game especially designed, based on systematic refutations of skeptical arguments.

A part of the dialogue is reinterpreted through a generative process of musical improvisation grounded in latest research in music and generative machine learning. The chanted terms circulate in space, spatialized on eight sources. If via cognitive sciences, computational logic helps to discern the truth, the sound piece leads to the exploration of new digital mediation frameworks for the climate.

Echoing a philosophy of disautomation, as the philosopher Bernard Stiegler may propose, CCM works as a counterpoint to the determinism of technical automation, while opening up to participatory dimensions and the ethical understanding of data processing. The research extends in more workshops, during exhibitions and in new contexts.
